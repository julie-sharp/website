title:  Fears & Phobias Programme
excerpt: Do you have an overwhelming and debilitating fear of something? An object or place or situation, perhaps? Do you avoid taking foreign holidays because you hate flying? Do you experience palpitations when you see a balloon, clown or dog? Do you find you can't eat or speak in front of others? Would you describe yourself as 'terrified' of the dentist? If so, then you are not alone; it is estimated there are around 10 million such suffers in the UK alone.

Suffering from an **extreme fear or phobia** causes people to organise their life in such a way so as to **avoid the thing causing fear or anxiety**.  Sufferers usually know their fear is irrational, but they **cannot control it**. Depending on the type and nature of the phobia, doing this can range from being relatively easy to achieve (because the cause of the phobia is so rare, for example), to incredibly difficult to do (as is the case with sufferes who fear social interaction).

Some of the most common phobias include a fear of **heights, spiders, snakes, dogs, flying, being sick and needles**. However many people also suffer from an irrational fear of **balloons** (*Globophobia*), **clowns** (*Coulrophobia*), being **without mobile phone** coverage (*Nomophobia*) and **knees** (*Genuphobia*).

## So where do phobias come from?

Well, **phobias are often rooted in early life** experiences and may occur for a number of reasons. Where phobias run in the family, this is almost always learned behaviour, however, events that a child perceives as traumatic can also sow the seed for a phobia to develop.

## So how do we treat a phobia?

Using an advanced uncovering technique, I seek to identify the **root cause of the phobia** and then reframe the event to enable the individual to feel differently about the cause. Often, the client discovers a memory they never knew they had.

Hypnotherapy can also help with relaxation and visualisation techniques for desensitisation and forming new habits such as being more calm and relaxed.
