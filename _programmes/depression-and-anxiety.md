title:  Depression and Anxiety Programme
excerpt: Anxiety and depression are often linked but they are not the same thing. Most people experience some form of anxiety when facing particularly stressful situations but anxiety disorders are severe and can disrupt the day-to-day life of an individual. Depression is a common psychological disorder and is more than just feeling unhappy, bored or fed up. There isn't a single cause of depression, but hypnotherapy is gaining wider recognition as a depression treatment as it seeks to uncover the root cause of the negative feelings and emotion, thus removing the symptoms of depression.

### Am I anxious or depressed?

Whilst anxiety and depression often go hand in hand, they are **not the same**. Some people suffer from anxiety, some from depression, some suffer from both simultaneously.

Itâ€™s not always easy to know whether you are feeling anxious or depressed, but asking yourself the following questions can help clarify.

### Anxiety

- Worrying about the future or what could or might happen.
- Worrying that things will or could go wrong.
- Wanting to run away, bury your ehad in the sand or otherwise avoid things that could cause further anxiety.

### Depression

- Having a sense of hopelessness and sadness about the future.
- Feeling listless and not believing that anything positive will happen.
- Rather than worrying thoughts, thoughts are more focused on the certainty of future negative emotions and, in severe cases, possible suicidal thoughts.

**People suffering with anxiety often find themselves worrying that something bad will happen. People with depression normally assume that bad things will happen but they are more resigned to this, believing that nothing will prevent it from being so.**
