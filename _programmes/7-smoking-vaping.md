Smoking Cessation Programme
Investing in the Sharp Minds Stop Smoking programme can save you money as well as your health. In just 39 smoke-free days, someone who smokes twenty-a-day will have recovered the value of their financial investment. How can that not make sense?

* Proven Clinical Approach
* Backed up by twenty years’ clinical practice to help you reach a point where stopping smoking just feels more natural than continuing.
* Advanced hypnotherapeutic and NLP techniques combined with methods rooted in the psychology and neuroscience of addiction.
* FREE Initial Consultation up to one hour to assess whether you are ready to quit – if I don’t think you’re ready yet, I will be honest with you.
* Personalised Sessions
* Two 90-120 minute sessions, personalised recording(s) plus free optional follow up within 12 months.

There are many approaches to smoking cessation, but the one I use, after specialist training, fits with who I am and what I understand about addiction, psychology and the human brain. It is based on clinical evidence gained from more than 20 years of working with smokers. That’s important to me and it may be to you too? It is a gentle approach that will move you from a place of dependency to a place where it just feels more natural and right not to smoke than it does to continue.

So how do I address this addiction?

* I won’t badger you into giving up; after all, no-one else has been successful in that, and I can’t imagine for a minute that I would be any different.
* I won’t insist that we follow a rigid format.
* I won’t hurry you along nor slow you down.
* I won’t devise a treatment plan without considering the context of your current lifestyle.
* I will tailor the session around your individual needs.
* I will be responsive to what crops up in the session.
* I will use a range of different techniques drawn from the fields of hypnosis, NLP, neuroscience and psychology as best fit the need.
* I will make myself available for telephone support in between sessions.
* I will tell you in the pre-consultation if I think you’re not yet ready.

Helping you achieve freedom from cigarettes permanently is important for me, not because I think it’s bad, but because it’s what you want. My sole concern is that you might live the kind of life you want to live, free from the habits and behaviours which hold you back.

We all deserve that, to live the best lives we possibly can. My happiness comes from your success. Instead of the lure of snapping open a packet, you will be able to pack it in.

If you want to work with someone who understands the nature of physical and psychological addiction, who adopts a broad-based and flexible approach drawing on diverse therapeutic interventions, and who has the skill to create a ‘pick and mix’ menu of treatment which is just right for you, then please book an appointment now for a pre-consultation.

Smoking is the major preventable cause of death in the UK today and a relatively costly way to go too, the price of tobacco having increased by 87% over the ten years from 2004 to 2014. A 50 year study shows that half to two thirds of all lifelong cigarette smokers will be eventually killed by their habit, normally due to lung cancer, chronic obstructive lung disease or coronary heart disease. Death is usually preceded by several years’ ill health and, not infrequently, early retirement due to chronic disease.

If you want to quit your habit and regain your health, the Smoking Cessation programme offered by Sharp Minds Hypnotherapy is offered as a two session programme, with a free follow-up if required within the first six months and costs £325 which is equivalent to what someone who smokes twenty a day would spend in just 39 days!

The Smoking Cessation programme also comes with personalised audio recordings.  A free pre-appointment consultation (telephone or, ideally, face-to-face) is required prior to booking. Sessions are around one and a half hours.

A smoker who smokes twenty cigarettes a day spends around £3,000 per year. You can use the following calculator to find out how much your smoking habit is costing you.

Stopping smoking does not just make financial sense; there are a range of health benefits too, which occur from the time you stop smoking.  Here’s a table of the physical effects of smoking and stopping smoking (source: NHS):

Negative Effect	Positive effect
Skin	Reduces oxygen to the skin ageing it more quickly.	Stopping smoking has been found to reduce the appearance of wrinkles. The skin of a non-smoker gets more nutrients, including oxygen, which reverses the sallow, lined complexion that smokers often have.
Mouth	Increases risk of mouth cancer and gum disease.	Kicking the smoking habit gives the sense of smell and taste a real boost, as the body recovers from being dulled by the hundreds of toxic chemicals in cigarettes.
Throat	Increases the risk of throat cancer.	Reduces the chance of developing a cough caused by the hundreds of toxic chemicals in cigarettes.
Heart	Clogs the arteries, causes heart attacks and strokes.	Within a year of stopping, the risk of a heart attack falls to about half that of a continuing smoker. After ten years, the risk falls to the same level as someone who never smoked.
Lungs	Causes lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.	Stop smoking and lung capacity could improve by up to 10% within nine months. Lung capacity naturally diminishes with age so not smoking can make all the difference when it comes to having an active and healthy old age.
Fertility	Increases chances of miscarriage, cervical cancer, and complications during pregnancy and delivery.	Quitting smoking improves the lining of the womb increasing the possibility of conceiving and reducing the likelihood of having a miscarriage. Most important, it improves the chances of giving birth to a healthy baby.
Sex	May reduce blood flow and cause impotence, and can damage sperm.	Men who quit may get better erections and women may find orgasms improved and become aroused more easily. The body’s blood flow improves and this heightens sensitivity.
Fitness	Carbon monoxide in cigarette smoke can lead to breathlessness.	Within two to 12 weeks of stopping smoking, the circulation improves making all physical activities much easier. The boost to the immune system makes it easier to fight off colds and flu.
