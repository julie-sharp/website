title:  Treatments Offered
excerpt: Though I refer to myself as a hypnotherapist, I use a much wider set of therapeutic interventions than just hypnosis. All the treatments I use in my practice are natural, non-invasive and use no medications. They simply rely upon the fact that the mind and body are connected, and the unconscious mind knows intuitively how to heal the body.

## Hypnotherapy
Hypnotherapy was my starting point and remains my passion. The ability to be hypnotized is universal - we hypnotise ourselves all the time. Sometimes positively, sometimes negatively, unfortunately. Hypnosis really just means being in a focussed state of attention. In that state, a person's peripheral awareness is reduced and their suggestibility is increased. We can make use of this to good effect.

For most people it is a very relaxing experience. A hypnotic trance state can be rather light, very deep and anywhere in between. A typical client in a typical session will experience the full range of trance experience. I use eyes-open conversational hypnosis as well as the more traditional eyes-closed hypnosis.

Hypnosis is not about losing control, but about gaining control. It is a natural internal resource that is freely available to us all. Used approriately, it can help facilitate amazing transformations in a person's well-being from smoking cessation and letting go of addictions, to boosting a person's sense of confidence and self-esteem, to dealing with fears, phobias and trauma. 

Above all, hypnosis is excellent for gaining access to a person's unconscious mind, which is generally where the problem is. After all, if the issue was in our conscious awareness, the chances are we would have resovled it without the need to visit a hypnotherapist!  

## Neurolinguistic Programming
NLP is the practice of understanding how people organise their thinking, feeling, language and behaviour to produce the results they do. NLP provides people with a methodology to model outstanding performances achieved by geniuses and leaders in their field. NLP is also used for personal development and for success in business

A key element of NLP is that we form our unique internal mental maps of the world as a product of the way we filter and perceive information absorbed through our five senses from the world around us.

*Neuro*
Each individual has established their own unique mental filtering system for processing the millions of bits of data being absorbed through the senses. Our first mental map of the world is constituted of internal images, sounds, tactile awareness, internal sensations, tastes and smells that form as result of the neurological filtering process. The first mental map is called ‘First Access’ in NLP.

*Linguistic*
We then assign personal meaning to the information being received from the world outside. We form our second mental map by assigning language to the internal images, sounds and feelings, tastes and smells, thus forming everyday conscious awareness. The second mental map is called the Linguistic Map (sometimes known as Linguistic Representation)

*Programming*
The behavioural response that occurs as a result of neurological filtering processes and the subsequent linguistic map.

## Human Givens
Human Givens is a psychotherapeutic approach which asserts that every human being shares a common biological inheritance of physical and emotional needs. These needs have evolved over millennia and are now programmed into our genetic make-up. They are the driving force behind our ability to successfully respond and adapt to our environment.

## BLAST Technique
The BLAST Technique® is an Amygdala Desensitising Technique (ADT) which has been created and developed to work fast and effectively with PTSD and trauma. It has its roots in Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR).

## OldPain2Go
OldPain2Go® works on the basis that our emotional pain and our physical pain share the same neural pathways – what applies to one applies to the other. Quite simply, pain is a message that prompts a person to take appropriate action. 

I work with people to interact with their unconscious to point out when pain is no longer a message that is necessary, and to delete it (by talking directly to the unconscious, but without trance).
