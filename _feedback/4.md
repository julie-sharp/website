"Having **struggled to control my drinking for many years** and pretty much exhausted all other avenues I decided to try hypnotherapy, something I had considered in the past but not progressed due to a lack of understanding regarding how this would work.
From the moment I met Julie I knew I had made the right decision, Julie has a professional, calming approach and at great ability to explain the process to be undertaken. We agreed my objectives and commenced a course of therapy. **The results from the very start were amazing** culminating in me taking control of my drinking and drastically reducing my intake primarily by **completely stopping my white wine binge drinking**. I cannot recommend Julie enough, **I feel I have my life back, more energy, far more control and simply a better quality of life.**
Thank you Julie, I am determined to maintain the progress."
