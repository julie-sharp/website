"Dear Julie, We hope that this email finds you and the family well. [My daughter] wanted me to send you an update on how things have been since returning to school in September.

[She] has been listening to her last recording from you Monday to Friday every morning when she wakes up and has achieved  95% attendance as we have had a couple of days with some wobbles and has also all of her lessons apart from PE,  which is a massive achievement for her compared to last school year. She is so proud of herself as are we.
We have encouraged [her] to keep a diary in which she has chosen to spilt the diary in half so that she can put down what if any have been negatives for the day or what have been positives.  She is able to see very clearly each day that the positives are increasing and the negatives are very very low.
[My husband] and I feel she is now in such a better place and is happy and socialising more at home by spending time downstairs with us rather than sat in her room. Her school report has just come home and she is reaching the expected level of learning in all subjects except French where she is exceeding.
We are all so thankful for the help and support you have given us as not sure where we would have been had we not been to see you.
Thank you once again.
All our Love"
