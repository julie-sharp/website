## ETHICAL STANDARDS
I am registered with the CNHC (Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council).
You can check out my registration here: www.cnhc.org.uk. The CNHC is a
government supported body that regulates a wide range of complementary
therapies. It ensures individuals meet National Occupational Standards, are of
good character and fit to practise.

As a member of that body, I am bound by the CNHC Code of Conduct, Ethics and
Performance. The CNHC places a duty on me to protect the health and wellbeing of my clients by using the best available research evidence, clinical expertise and taking into consideration the values of my clients. In particular, I am bound to:

* respect clients’ dignity, individuality and privacy;
* respect clients’ rights to be involved in decisions about their care;
* justify public trust and confidence by being honest and trustworthy;
* provide a good standard of practice and care;
* protect clients and colleagues from risk of harm; and
* co-operate with colleagues from my own and other professions.

I am personally accountable for my actions and must, if asked, be able to explain
and justify my decisions when asked to do so.

I aspire to the highest standards of professional conduct. I do not have a
criminal record and have not been the subject of any disciplinary or civil
proceedings against me in relation to my practice.

I am required to continually maintain and update my professional knowledge
and skills and keep a CPD (continuing professional development) log. I read and
research extensively to expand my knowledge of hypnotherapy, NLP (neuro
linguistic programming) and psychology in general. I also participate in peer
support activities with other professional hypnotherapists and counsellors on a
weekly basis.

Collectively, my continuing professional development activities (which include
seminars, training courses, reading and other interventions) far exceed the
minimum requirement imposed by the CNHC.

Clients have a right to expect that the information obtained about them in the
course of my work, will be held in confidence. For information on how this
information is used and kept, please see the Privacy page.
