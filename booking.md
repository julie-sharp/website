Sharp Minds supports clients to deal with a range of issues including addictions, confidence, self-esteem, pain control, anxiety, depression, fears and phobias. A **free pre-appointment consultation** will be arranged to discuss the nature of the problem and the desired results you are looking for, so that the most appropriate programme can be determined in advance of the treatment commencing. If there is any doubt as to whether hypnotherapy would not be appropriate, or if I believe that it would be contraindicated, I will say so and explain my reasoning.  This ensures that there is a clear understanding of the behaviour the client is seeking to change and that the most appropriate course of treatment is chosen. All bookings of hypnotherapy appointments require a face-to-face pre-consultation.

## Bronze, Silver, Gold & Platinum Packages

For all treatments except Smoking Cessation, different packages are offered according to the nature and severity of the issue. These are broadly based around the length of time it may take to resolve the problem. They are the **Bronze, Silver, Gold** and **Platinum** packages. All programmes come with at least one **personalised audio recording**.

## Smoking Cessation Programme

The Smoking Cessation programme is offered as a two session programme, with a free follow-up if required within the first twelve months.  The Smoking Cessation programme also comes with personalised audio recordings.

## Booking your Hypnotherapy Appointments

Hypnotherapy is a relatively quick therapy. Rarely is it necessary to see people for more than 8 sessions and in some cases, just a couple will suffice depending on the nature of the issue(s) to be resolved. Sessions are around one and a half hours. Payment must be made in full at the time of booking.

## Lateness

Should you arrive late for any hypnotherapy appointments, then your therapy session will be reduced accordingly unless it is possible and agreeable to extend your session. An extension will not be offered where this would adversely impact on another client’s session.

## Cancellations

I endeavour to give my Clients the best service I possibly can and part of this is offering the earliest appointment slot possible. It is inevitable that from time to time a client may need to reschedule an appointment. I would ask, however, that where this is the case, you give as much notice as possible so that others are not unduly affected by your cancellation. **Sharp Minds Hypnotherapy reserves the right to charge the full session fee for cancellations made with less than 24 hours’ notice**. Your booking an appointment confirms your acceptance of this.

## Weekend and Evening Appointments

Office hours are from 8.30am-5.30pm, Monday to Friday, excluding bank holidays. Should you require an appointment outside of normal office hours i.e. at a weekend or in the evening then this can usually be arranged. Weekend and evening appointments carry a supplement of £25.
