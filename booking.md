## Booking your Hypnotherapy Appointments

All bookings of hypnotherapy appointments require a telephone or face-to-face pre-consultation, which is offered free of charge. This ensures that there is a clear understanding of the behaviour the client is seeking to change and that the most appropriate course of treatment is chosen.

Payment must be made in full at the time of booking and can be made by bank transfer to

Sort Code: **40-46-39**, Account no.: **11879197**

or by [Paypal](...).

If you wish to pay by cheque or in cash, please contact me directly.

Hypnotherapy is a relatively quick therapy. Rarely is it necessary to see people for more than 8 sessions and in some cases, just a couple will suffice depending on the nature of the issue(s) to be resolved. Sessions are around one and a half hours. Following are the key programmes offered:

## Weight Loss – Mini, Midi & Maxi Programmes

Weight issues are often multi-faceted and can be complicated to resolve. An approach that works for one client may not be appropriate for another. For this reason, a number of different programmes are offered for weight management. The Weight Loss programme is divided into **Mini, Midi** and **Maxi** depending on the particular needs of the client and the amount of weight the client wishes to lose. In addition, Sharp Minds also offers the **Virtual Gastric Band** programme, which is geared more towards portion control and is therefore more suitable for clients who are in the habit of eating larger quantities.

As part of the Weight Loss Programme, and in addition to the one-to-one therapy sessions, personal on-going coaching and support is offered between sessions to help clients stay on track and achieve their goals. The **Mini, Midi** and **Maxi** programmes also come with personalised audio recordings.

Sharp Minds offers a free pre-appointment consultation to discuss the nature of the problem and the desired results, so that the most appropriate programme can be determined in advance of the treatment commencing.

## Smoking Cessation Programme

The Smoking Cessation programme is offered as a two session programme, with a free follow-up if required within the first six months.  The Smoking Cessation programme also comes with personalised audio recordings.

A **free pre-appointment consultation** (telephone or face-to-face) is required prior to booking.

## Bronze, Silver, Gold & Platinum Packages

For treatments for all other areas (i.e. except weight and smoking), including addictions, confidence, self-esteem, pain control, anxiety, depression and fears, phobias, a number of different packages are offered according to the nature and severity of the issue. These are broadly based around the length of time it may take to resolve the problem. The **Bronze, Silver, Gold** and **Platinum** packages come with **personalised audio recordings**.

Sharp Minds offers a **free pre-appointment consultation** to discuss the nature of the problem and the desired results, so that the most appropriate programme can be determined in advance of the treatment commencing.

## Lateness

Should you arrive late for any hypnotherapy appointments, then your therapy session will be reduced accordingly unless it is possible and agreeable to extend your session. An extension will not be offered where this would adversely impact on another client’s session.

## Cancellations

I endeavour to give my Clients the best service I possibly can and part of this is offering the earliest appointment slot possible. It is inevitable that from time to time a client may need to reschedule an appointment. I would ask, however, that where this is the case, you give as much notice as possible so that others are not unduly affected by your cancellation. **Sharp Minds Hypnotherapy reserves the right to charge the full session fee for cancellations made with less than 24 hours’ notice**. Your booking an appointment confirms your acceptance of this.

## Weekend and Evening Appointments

Office hours are from 8.30am-5.30pm, Monday to Friday, excluding bank holidays. Should you require an appointment outside of normal office hours i.e. at a weekend or in the evening then this can usually be arranged. Weekend and evening appointments carry a supplement of £25.
