Hypnotherapy for children is considered to be highly effective and completely safe. **Children tend to respond well to hypnosis as they are naturally imaginative and use their subconscious far more than is the case with adults**. Children also spend considerably more time with their brains in “alpha” mode (which is the naturally occurring hypnotic state). Hypnotherapy can help to address a number of issues commonly experienced in childhood and adolescence including **fears, bed soiling or wetting, exam and test nerves, anxiety, low self-esteem and eating disorders**.
