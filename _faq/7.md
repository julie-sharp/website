**Hypnosis occurs when the brain waves slow from "beta" to "alpha"**. The human brain passes in and out of "alpha" mode on a daily basis. Technically, therefore, anyone can be hypnotised.

**Hypnosis simply means "focussed state of attention"**, so any time we are in a focussed state of attention – **such as reading a good book or watching a good film** – we are, effectively, in a state of hypnosis. We are easily suggestible in this state; suggestible enough to cry at a sad film or feel our heart race in a horror movie. That said, **some people are more suggestible than others and children particularly so**.

However if a person does not wish to be hypnotised then they won’t be. **A hypnotic state cannot be achieved without the client’s (conscious or subconscious) consent, but achieving a hypnotic state is an easy and enjoyable experience**. All you need to do is be able to follow an instruction and use your imagination. If you can do that, can suspend any scepticism and are committed to the process, then hypnosis will follow. And with hypnosis comes healing.
