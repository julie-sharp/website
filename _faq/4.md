Hypnotherapy is **widely endorsed as a treatment for stress and anxiety related issues, pain control and habit breaking**. For a comprehensive list of uses, please see my [Common Uses]( {{ "/hypnotherapy-uses/" | absolute_url }} ) page. Whilst hypnotherapy is still not widely available on the NHS, some private health insurers now cover it, and in recent years it has been gaining steam in the medical world after a recommendation from the *National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)*, which now recognises hypnotherapy as an **effective treatment for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)**. Hypnotherapy can be used very effectively either in tandem with traditional Western medicine or independently after other avenues have been exhausted.
