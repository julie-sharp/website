[Hypnosis]({{ "/what-is-hypnosis/" | relative_url }}) is a **very natural state** that our bodies enter into naturally at least twice a day as we pass in and out of sleep. We also enter into a hypnotic state when we switch to "automatic pilot" when driving a familiar route or when we become engrossed in something such as a good film or book.

A film that we know, consciously, to be acted by actors, following a fictitious script can cause us to feel real fear or cry real tears. In other words, something imagined can produce a physical effect!

This is possible because whilst the conscious mind has what is known as a "critical faculty" (the ability to analyse and think), **our subconscious minds do not and cannot
distinguish between what is real and what is imagined**.

This is why a nightmare can be so terrifying to a young child. In hypnosis, the conscious mind is dampened down or switched to "idle" and the subconscious becomes both more easily accessible and more open to suggestion. In this way, any **negative and unhelpful behaviours, memories or beliefs can be replaced with positive suggestions** purely through use of the imagination and visualization techniques.
