Think of hypnosis as a ladder; an individual will typically move up and down that ladder and may be anywhere between a very light state of hypnosis or a very deep state. Whilst everyone’s experience of hypnosis is different, **most people report feeling deeply relaxed** – sometimes being unable to feel parts of their body, or feeling very light or very heavy – but most remain completely **aware of what’s going on**. They may tune in and out slightly as they begin to “drop off” but if the phone were to ring within earshot they would hear it, but probably not be bothered to do anything about it. Someone in a very deep state of hypnosis (somnambulism), which is fairly rare, may not hear the phone at all. As a rule, people experiencing hypnosis will feel **profoundly peaceful and both physically and mentally relaxed on awakening** from the trance state.
