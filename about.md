## About Julie Sharp

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/julie_sharp.jpg" | relative_url }}" alt="" /></span>

My name is **Julie Sharp** and I founded **Sharp Minds Hypnotherapy** in order to **help people change their lives** for the better.

I am a **fully qualified Hypnotherapist & NLP practitioner** and am **registered** with the **CNHC** (Complimentary and Natural Healthcare Council), **GHSC** (General Hypnotherapy Standards Council) and **HSOH** (Hampshire School of Hypnotherapy). I was trained by Lorraine Gleeson of Hampshire School of Hypnotherapy whose approach was personally commended to me by C. Roy Hunter, a globally recognised leader in the hypnotherapy profession and author of several highly acclaimed published works. My training spanned a year and involved over 450 hours of theory and practice. Although many hypnotherapists practise script reading alone, I have been taught to **deal with root causes using IMR** (ideo-motor response) and other advanced uncovering techniques. Whilst a script reading only approach can bring about a permanent change, this depends on the susceptibility of the client and on there being no underlying causes that may act as a subconscious blocker.

I am also a trained **Virtual Gastric Band** therapist, am a **Parts Therapy** practitioner, **taught by the world-renowned C Roy Hunter**, have been trained to **Lift Depression Fast**, using a Human Givens approach. I believe learning never stops and I learn as much from my clients and day-to-day practice, as I do from attending formal courses and reading books and other literature.

### Freedom from self-limiting beliefs

  <p>
  On a final note, I believe that we should seek to help enrich the lives of others, not leave them impoverished. I didn’t come into hypnotherapy to become a world-famous stage hypnotist, nor to make my fortune, I came into hypnotherapy in order to help others live more fulfilling lives, <b>free from self-limiting beliefs</b> about what they can or can’t do or achieve, who they are or who they aren’t and the negative behaviours that trap the person into feeling other than how they truly wish to feel.

I am non-judgemental in life generally, but particularly so in hypnotherapy. In a sense (and with no disrespect), I don’t care what has caused an issue in my clients’ lives, or what has happened to them in the past. Whatever it was, it didn’t kill them! I have no interest in drawing a particular conclusion about their predicament; my interest lies in their future, in helping them **cut the ties that bind them (consciously or subconsciously) to past events**. I am here to affirm life not criticize it; in helping my clients **achieve freedom from the thoughts and behaviours** that they feel have been holding them back. We all deserve to **live the best lives we possibly can** and my happiness comes from their [success](../client-feedback/index.html).
